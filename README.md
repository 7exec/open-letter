# Plan Vert
## An open letter to the Rails Core team and community

David Heinemeier-Hanson (DHH) has publicly published writings that make clear he holds racist and transphobic views, as well as a number of other traits undesirable in any figurehead and community leader.

We, the undersigned, call upon the Rails Core team, with the support of the wider Ruby community, to:

1. cut ties with DHH and his work from this point forward
2. hard fork Rails and associated projects to a new name and development free from his influence
3. adopt a modern Code of Conduct with suitable community governance

If a forked Rails project can meet these criteria, we pledge to support and cheerlead it to the best of our ability, and will make efforts to change our Rails code to use it at the earliest opportunity.

### Notes (non-normative)

* ["Plan Vert"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_sabotage_during_World_War_II#France) was a railway sabotage campaign by the French resistance during WW2. Reference suggested by [@cinebox@masto.hackers.town](https://masto.hackers.town/@cinebox/115210459164892947).

* DHH's writings are available on [his blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20250920182553/world.hey.com/dhh); we link the archive.org mirror rather than send traffic his way.

* Many people have written their own thoughts on this (which is not a new problem, but is reaching new levels). Here's a selection:
  * [David Celis: Rails Needs New Governance](https://davidcel.is/articles/rails-needs-new-governance)
  * [Tekin Süleyman: The Ruby community has a DHH problem](https://tekin.co.uk/2025/09/the-ruby-community-has-a-dhh-problem)
  * [Tom Stuart: The DHH Problem](https://tomstu.art/the-dhh-problem) (old, but illustrative)
